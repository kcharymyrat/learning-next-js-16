    answer: `Berserk. It's about a warrior born from a dead flesh of a hanged mother, marked by the brand of sacrifice by apostles of the devil themselves. But he never gave a fuck and fought them as if he were immortal, despite the unending enemies and absence of hope for escape. Through his endless struggle, he became a creator of his own destiny and escaped unavoidable death at the Eclipse.`
